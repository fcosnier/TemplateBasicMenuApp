TemplateBasicMenuApp
====================

Template with Menu like Menu Drawer

# Needs: #
- [ABS(ActionBarSherlock)](https://github.com/flofichou/ActionBarSherlock)
- [SlidingMenu(jfeinstein10)](https://github.com/flofichou/SlidingMenu)

# To do: #
If you want to compile the project, you need to add the two previous libraries.

# Possible problems: #
Maybe you meet some problems during the compilation like noDefFound, to fix it, you have to add the android-support-v4.jar in the library SlidingMenu and in the tab "Order and Export"(Java Build Path), you have to check Android Private Libraries. Do exactly the same for the library ABS.

## VERY IMPORTANT ##
 Don't check android-support-v4.jar in the tab "Order and Export"(Java Build Path) in both libraries

In your main project, go to the tab "Order and Export"(Java Build Path) and check Android Private Libraries
